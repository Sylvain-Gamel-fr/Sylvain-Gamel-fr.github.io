summary:
    You may already know how to create a PDF with the print 
    function of your Mac.


    _Would you know how to do more?_


    Can you find your documents with the Finder?


    You see your PDFs with _Preview_, but do you know that 
    they can be annotated or modified?

sideNote:
    If you are handling paper documents and your goal is to pass 
    as much as possible to the paperless, this book is for you!

---

This book will teach you all this, but also how to explore 
the capabilities of Preview to make it a drawing tool.

You will also see how to use a scanner to digitize your documents.

For the most advanced users, you will discover how _PDF services_ 
can help you _automate_ certain processes.

And if you have the impression that your Mac is not enough for you, 
I propose to push the limits with complementary applications.

And unlike your Mac, your iPhone fits in your pocket 
and can become a real mobile office.

You will discover how the iPad and iPhone complete your Mac.

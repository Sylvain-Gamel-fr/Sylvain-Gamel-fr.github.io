### Data gathering

#### _Do our applications collect your personal data??_

No, we do not collect personal information.


#### _Do you store the data entered in the application??_

No, your data belongs to you and we do not have any right on them.

However, it may happen that an entered value appears in a crash report
of an application.
They can then only be used to solve the problem,
without being able to bind it to a particular person.

This data is anonymous and without any other possible use.

#### _What information can be collected by our applications?_

Some anonymous technical information.

Our applications use statistical tools that collect anonymous information 
about your use of software:

- What type of terminal do you use, and with which version of 
  iOS operating system?
- How many people use the software, how often and how long?
- Do you encounter any planes that we could correct?

Applications currently use either the tools provided by Apple to developers, 
or [Crashlytics](https://crashlytics.com/) tools to collect anonymous 
statistics and crash reports.

### Advertising Targeting

Our free apps use Google Ads.

This system does not give us access to your personal information and may 
collect limited and anonymous information.

You can specify your preferences in the privacy settings of your iPhone/iPad.
